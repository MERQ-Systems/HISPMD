This initiative aimed to provide a more holistic evaluation of RHIS-strengthening interventions, potentially leading to more targeted and effective improvements in Ethiopia\'s health information system. A cross-sectional assessment of health facilities selected using the cluster sampling method was conducted between May 12 â€“ June 3, 2024. The health facilities covered by this assessment include 90 health posts, 120 health centres, and eight primary hospitals from 35 woredas drawn from Addis Ababa City, Sidama, Oromia, Somali, and Gambella regions. Adapted PRISM tools, including diagnostic tools and facility/office checklists, were used to assess the situation of HIS in the health institutions. The Organizational and Behavioral Assessment Tool (OBAT) was also used to interview 507 staff from these facilities. Among the components of the PRISM assessment, this assessment did not use the Management Assessment Tool (MAT) and the Electronic RHIS Performance Assessment Tool.'
